# Goal: Benchmark AbLangPDB against other models

## Minimum Viable Product:
- 2 Models: AbLangRBD vs AbLangPDB
- 2 datasets: RBD and PDB datasets
- 3 Metrics: F1, ROC-AUC, and Avg. Prec

## Extract out 

## Next Round of Models to implement if time is available:
- (Existing) AbLang, Seq Identity, CDRH3 identity
- (New) ParaPred, ABodyBuilder2 (or is it ImmuneBuilder?)
- (More) AntiBERTa2-CSSP, IgBERT, ESM-2 or 3,
